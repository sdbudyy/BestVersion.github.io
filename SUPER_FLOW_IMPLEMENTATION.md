# Super Flow Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a stunning Super Flow slider animation to the "Everything you need to manage your EITs" section on the Enterprise page. The animation is inspired by the [UI Initiative Super Flow component](https://uiinitiative.com/catalog/super-flow) and features smooth sliding transitions with staggered content animations.

- **Gradient Overlays**: Subtle gradient overlays that animate on hover
- **Smooth Transitions**: All animations use cubic-bezier easing for natural movement

### Interactive Elements
- **Custom Navigation**: Styled navigation arrows with hover effects
- **Custom Pagination**: Interactive pagination dots with active states
- **Autoplay**: Automatic slide transitions with pause on hover
- **Touch Support**: Full touch/swipe support for mobile devices
