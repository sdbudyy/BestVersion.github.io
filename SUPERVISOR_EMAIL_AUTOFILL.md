# Supervisor Email Autofill Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds autofill functionality for the validators popup when editing. When users start typing an email address, the system suggests supervisors that they are connected with.

## Features

- **Email-based autocomplete**: As users type in the email field, connected supervisors are suggested
- **Auto-fill name fields**: When a supervisor is selected, their first and last name are automatically filled
- **Connected supervisors only**: Only shows supervisors that have an active connection with the current EIT
- **Real-time search**: Searches as the user types (minimum 2 characters)
- **Responsive UI**: Dropdown with supervisor email and name for easy selection

## Implementation Details

### New Component: `SupervisorEmailAutocomplete`

**Location**: `src/components/references/SupervisorEmailAutocomplete.tsx`

**Key Features**:
- Fetches connected supervisors from `supervisor_eit_relationships` table
- Searches supervisors by email using `ilike` query
- Extracts first and last name from supervisor's `full_name`
- Provides callback with email, firstName, and lastName

**Props**:
```typescript
interface SupervisorEmailAutocompleteProps {
  value: string;
  onChange: (email: string, firstName?: string, lastName?: string) => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

### Updated Component: `ValidatorPopup`

**Location**: `src/pages/References.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Replaced email input with `SupervisorEmailAutocomplete` component
- Added `handleEmailChange` function to handle autocomplete selection
- Auto-fills first and last name fields when supervisor is selected

### Database Query

The component queries the `supervisor_eit_relationships` table to find connected supervisors:

```sql
SELECT supervisor_id 
FROM supervisor_eit_relationships 
WHERE eit_id = current_user_id 
AND status = 'active'
```

Then searches the `supervisor_profiles` table for matching emails:

```sql
SELECT id, full_name, email 
FROM supervisor_profiles 
WHERE email ILIKE '%search_term%' 
AND id IN (connected_supervisor_ids)
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the References page
2. Go to the Validators tab
3. Click "Add Validator" for any skill
4. Start typing in the email field
5. Connected supervisors will appear as suggestions
6. Click on a suggestion to auto-fill email, first name, and last name

## Benefits

- **Improved UX**: Users don't need to remember supervisor email addresses
- **Reduced errors**: Prevents typos in email addresses
- **Faster workflow**: Auto-fills name fields to save time
- **Connected supervisors only**: Ensures validators are from trusted connections

## Technical Notes

- Minimum 2 characters required before showing suggestions
- Maximum 5 suggestions displayed at once
- Case-insensitive email search
- Handles click-outside to close dropdown
- Proper error handling for database queries
- Responsive design with proper z-index for dropdown

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Caching supervisor connections for better performance
- Adding supervisor organization/position information
- Support for multiple email formats
- Keyboard navigation in dropdown
- Recent supervisors list
